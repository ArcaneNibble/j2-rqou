This is a mirror of the [J2 open processor](http://j-core.org/) with custom patches. The purpose of this repository is to keep track of which patches apply on top of what and to reduce the lossiness of dumping tons of patches onto the mailing list.

**WARNING:** Some of these patches change the behavior of the CPU in substantial (although often obscure) ways. Do not blindly use these patches without understanding what the patches are trying to do.
