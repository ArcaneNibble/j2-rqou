            vMAGIC is an API written in Java which helps you to create programs related to VHDL.
            vMAGIC comprises of three parts:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>a VHDL 93 compliant parser</li>
            <li>a programming model to easily create and modify VHDL constructs</li>
            <li>a VHDL Writer to generate code</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <img src="resources/hni-sct.png" alt="HNI SCT" style="float:right;"/>
        <p>To compile vMAGIC you need:</p>
